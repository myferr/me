        Music is one of my <b><i>favorite</i></b> things and I indulge in music quite often, with my love for music comes beliefs about music and here are some of those:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4 space-y-2 text-white">
        <li class="pl-2 max-w-3xl">you cannot rank music, music is emotional and can change with the listener. depending on how you feel is how you feel about the track, and music can be an embodiment of the listener's emotions.</li>
        <li class="pl-2 max-w-3xl">music should be listened to for the lyrical content and the depth, listening for sound is fine but listening for those other reasons are better (in my opinion)</li>
        <li class="pl-2 max-w-3xl">rap is a large genre and should not be looked down upon, at it's core rap is poetry and a beautiful genre that can articulate so much when given the chance</li>
    </ul>
