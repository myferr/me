      <p>
        I’m Myfer (pronounced
        <a
          href="https://ipa-reader.com/?text=%CB%88ma%C9%AA%CB%88f%C9%9D"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >/ˈmaɪˈfɝ/</a
        >), an online alias I use for most of my work.
      </p>

      <p>
        I focus on building <strong>useful, practical software</strong>. That
        usually means tools that solve real problems rather than demos or
        throwaway projects. I enjoy working across the full stack, from
        interfaces people actually use to the systems that power them
        underneath.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of what I build falls into a few categories: web applications,
        desktop apps, command-line tools, and reusable libraries for Python and
        JavaScript. I’m especially interested in software that’s fast,
        local-first, and easy to run without heavy infrastructure.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m 14 years old and I started programming in 2019 and have been
        learning continuously since.
      </p>

      <h3>How I work</h3>

      <p>
        I like understanding how things work end-to-end. Instead of only
        focusing on a single layer, I enjoy moving between frontend, backend,
        tooling, and deployment. This helps me build software that feels
        cohesive rather than stitched together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lately, I’ve been spending more time on local-first software,
        self-hosted services, and developer tooling. I’m currently learning more
        about structured databases and type-safe data access with tools like
        Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL.
      </p>

      <h3>Outside the code</h3>

      <p>
        I’m based in Florida. When I’m not coding, I usually spend time
        experimenting with new tools, refining existing projects, or learning
        how other systems are designed and maintained.
